# DesignPatternsInSwift
This repository contains all the code from my book 'Design Patterns in Swift', live at https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FYXHBKZ. All code written in Swift4. Do give a star if you like the work.

Personally, cricket is something that I understand in and out. I can almost relate anything under the sun to a situation in cricket (okay, that’s a bit of an exaggeration).
So, I decided, instead of using different contexts for each of the design pattern examples, I would be using cricketing terms for all the examples I would be coding. I believe cricket is a very simple game, and even for those who do not follow the game, it should not be a big effort to relate to the cricketing terms.

That’s when I decided instead of just letting the code reside on my Mac, I would put a little more effort to take it to book form. That’s how this book was born, and I am sure your understanding on design patterns will be enhanced by the time you finish coding these examples.

I would suggest you code the examples (not copy-paste, but type each and every line of the code) in your Xcode playground and see the results for yourself. Then imagine a
scenario where you would apply such a design pattern, and code an example for yourself.
I believe that’s how coding is learned. Happy learning!
